# Heart-Disease-indicator-using-Tableau
## SUMMARY
The project focuses on understanding the indicators that cause heart disease to predict the cases better. Our target audience is health institutions or health research centers. The Exploratory Data Analysis report can be used to understand which attributes have the most and least impact and select the appropriate attribute in their experiments. As for our purpose of the dashboard, we will find the relationship between heart disease and other attributes. We want to find out which attributes have a greater impact and the impact of different attribute combinations on heart disease.

## DATA DESCRIPTION
The dataset being used is taken from Kaggle. It has 18 variables, which are Binary (Heart Disease, Smoking, etc.), Numerical (BMI, Mental health check for past 30 days, etc.), Categorical (Sex, ethnicity, etc.), and Range (Age Range) types.

The dataset talks about indicators for heart disease in various ethnicities. According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and white people). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicator includes diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity, or drinking too much alcohol. Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare.
